# Asset Shuffle 1
 
Welcome to our first Asset Shuffle!

These will be a series of bi-weekly challenges where we'll pop in random assets and create a basic game structure for you to fill in the details and make it your own. Feel free to use as much or as little of the provided assets.

Our first Asset Shuffle consists of the following assets:  
- [Warped Space Shooter](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/warped-space-shooter-181590)
- [\[2D\] 8Bit Pixel Character Pack (8Bit Pirates)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/2d-8bit-pixel-character-pack-106860)
- [Hero Knight - Pixel Art](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/hero-knight-pixel-art-165188)

The preset code has basic movement for a lone spaceship.

The pack was built in Unity version **2019.4.21f1 (LTS)**.

Have fun!
